For many people it is a humiliating and demoralizing experience, having to ask for assistance to perform tasks related to personal hygiene while having a shower or bath.

The Halifax Brush Handle was invented by a person who has such a disability and will improve the quality of life for millions of people.

Resulting in our handle - making all other body care brush handles OBSOLETE.

If our new invented Halifax Brush Handles were to replace existing handles on back brushes, scrapers,,scrubbers, massage devices, it could transform all body care tools into a product which will be easier to use, safer and more efficient.

Not to mention, more relaxing and enjoyable.</p>
