	<p><h2>Problems & Solutions</h2><img src="Brushes1.jpg">
What problems exist currently?<br>
What are the solutions?<br>
A brush handle you are not required to grip with your thumb and with only two fingers have the ability to scrub the hardest and get to the most difficult parts of your body to clean.<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Gripping a wet and soapy back handle.</li><br>
		<li>Dropping a back brush while hands are wet and soapy.</li><br>
		<li>The inability to control and apply pressure while washing the back.</li><br>
	</ul>
There are a few ways our invention helps.<br>
<br>
Because the handle uses your two fingers, no thumb needed, it can't be dropped. At the same time, no strength is required to hold the brush. Giving those with limited dexterity and strength the comfort and control needed to clean themselves.
<br>
When you turn the head of the brush, it creates an unbelievable ability to produce force on the back and optimizes control and ability with less effort.
<br>
An important note to make is that our invention is designed to use with the very popular net sponge, which everyone has! Each member of the family can interchange their own sponge. 
<br>
All back brushes in the marketplace today will benefit by replacing their existing brush handles with the Halifax Brush Handle.<br>  
You have to try it to believe it!!
