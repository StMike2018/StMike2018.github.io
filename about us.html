	<p><h2>About Halifax Brush Handle Inc.</h2>
We are a small family business that was formed to bring our ideas for new inventions to the market place.<br>
<br>
First, the idea is recorded in our new invention log book.<br>
<br>
Then it's investigated to see if it would qualify as a new invention, customer base and its marketing possibilities.<br>
<br>
Third, we manufacture the prototypes.<br>
<br>
After careful consideration and consultation with our lawyers and all the proper channels regarding a new invention, we bring it to the world.<br>
<br>
Our first invention - The Halifax Brush Handle - was invented by the President of Halifax Brush Handle Inc. who himself, suffers from a disability and on his journey for a more relaxing and comfortable experience in personal care products, dreamed and designed <em>"The Halifax Brush Handle"</em>.
